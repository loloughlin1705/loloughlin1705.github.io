								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>For my Project Idea, my service will make it so Cryptocurrency will be able to be used in the real world. The process of being able to bring out your phone and scan a QR code generated
									by the retailer will bring ease to the customer if they need to pay by other means. </p>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>My main motivation for this project is because of my involvement during this ever-growing market of Cryptocurrency. I want to be a part of the movement by making Cryptocurrency a part of our future and making purchases much easier. A study conducted by BusinessInsider suggested that there are roughly above 100 million active cryptocurrency users (ROBERTSON, 2021) which is approximately 1.282% of the world’s population. Knowing this, I can see these numbers rise significantly in the coming future seeing as now even the big corporations (WILLIAMS, 2021) are joining in and buying huge amounts of Bitcoin.</p>
								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>As mentioned, this service will provide an easy solution for In-store purchases to customers that use Cryptocurrency on a day-to-day basis and may even encourage newcomers to do the same. On the retailer's end, a simple click of the “Generate QR code” will generate a UNIQUE QR code for the customer to scan with either a mobile device via an QR Scanning app or their camera app. The QR code generated will be a wallet address for our service which then we pay the retailer the difference in the desired currency of the retailer (for us AUD).

									As this will be a mostly online service requiring a mobile device to be connected to the internet, we would need to have a way to pay offline as well. Our service will allow you to have your own personal online wallet hosted by us which you can top up when you plan to be out on the go, with this the retailer can change the QR to an offline solution, a confirmation through text, followed up by a 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) on your mobile device via our services app, which you would then enter on the retailer’s device to confirm the purchase. The wallet feature would also allow your Cryptocurrency to grow in value as the Cryptocurrency market never closes.

									We would supply the device which will Generate the QR wallet code, along with the training for the retail team members. This device will support the retailers POS system and a certified technician will be always available for assistance if any issues were to arise.
								</p>
								<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
								<p>One of the main tools we would use is a machine similar to CommBank’s “Albert”. A simple to use User-friendly App based EFTPOS machine/tablet. This will be mainly used in the retailer’s stores.
									Another essential tool will be “Bitcoin Core”, this is an open-source wallet system which allows for most of the payment side of this project to be handled. The QR generator system, invoice and Bitcoin tracking is all implemented through this.
								</p>
								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<p>An essential skill to be required would be a team of programmers with extensive knowledge on POSXML, C and C++.
									Along with programmers we would need someone with experience in IT support/Maintenance and a similar amount of knowledge in the programming field as well.
								</p>
								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p>One of the big outcomes of this project will be a new step towards implementing a once mainly online currency, into one that can be used anywhere in the world. One of the original problems before this project was that Crypto had not many uses in the real world; it was mainly used as an Investment. Now that there will be a more practical way of being able to use your Crypto not just as an investment and more like an actual currency, I feel that this project could impact the start of a new wave of how Cryptocurrency is used.</p>
